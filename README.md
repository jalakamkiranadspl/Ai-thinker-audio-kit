## Developing with the ESP-ADF

### Quick Start


You need [version 3.3.1 of ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/versions.html) to provide the toolchain, the ESP32-LyraT board and headphone connected.

**Note:**  If this is your first exposure to ESP32 and ESP-IDF, proceed to [Getting Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/index.html) documentation.

Clone the ESP-ADF repository, set up `ADF_PATH`, and then compile, flash and monitor applications in the same way as when working with ESP-IDF.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ai-Thinker-Open/ESP32-A1S-AudioKit.git
cd esp-adf/ai-examples/get-started/play_mp3
make menuconfig
make flash monitor
```

If you clone project without `--recursive` flag, please goto the `esp-adf` directory and run command `git submodule update --init` before doing anything.
